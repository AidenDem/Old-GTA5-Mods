# Old GTA5 Mods By AidenDem
## About
Old Grand Theft Auto 5 Mods that I made in ScriptHookVDotNet.  
The code will probably be really bad and unoptimized, I've done a few minor modifications to the mods.

Do with it what you want, modify it, reupload it, do whatever u want!
## Mods
### 'ImprovedPoliceAndResponseNotificationSys' (aka Juggernaut System)
A small script originally meant to notify players about wanted level activities but was later remade into a juggernaut system.
I recently changed a few things in the code to get rid of unnecessary variables and ported it to SHVDN3.

Was released as an optional script for Improved Police & Response.
